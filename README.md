# Adaptive Offset Self-attention Network for 3D Point Cloud
  We propose a novel point cloud learning framework called adaptive offset self-attention network for the classification and segmentation tasks. It has permutation invariant when processing 3D point cloud data and can dynamically learn local features depending on the input features. To better fuse the local features, the maximum feature extraction (MFE) module is designed,which performs maximum feature weighting prior to local feature fusion. The method can concentrate the features and improve the robustness of the network. Through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, the proposed method has achieved advanced performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.
